## Advanced Segmentation

Similar to the Beginner Segmentation tutorial, this advanced tutorial will guide you through the segmentation of Nuclei, Cell and Cytoplasm objects with the additional difficulty of having to pre-process the images (perform illumination correction) and finding segmentation settings that work well enough across a large number of different images.

The images used come from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection
(https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC022).
They are Ô¨Åelds of U2OS cells (10 sites imaged in 5 channels), and
represent 5 mock treated wells from a single 384 well plate experiment.
