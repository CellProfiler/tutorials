msgid "In this experiment, we are working with human U2OS osteosarcoma (bone cancer) cells, in which a Forkhead-protein FOXO1A has been labeled with GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein). In proliferating cells, FOXO1A is localized in the cytoplasm; it is constantly moving into the nucleus, but is transported out again by export proteins. Upon inhibition of nuclear export, FOXO1A accumulates in the nucleus. We know that 150nM of Wortmannin (the drug we are using as a positive control in this experiment) inhibits transport of the FOXO1A protein from the nucleus back out to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Labeling FOXO1A with GFP allows us to visualize its subcellular localization. The goal of developing image-based screens of this type is to aid in the search for unknown drugs that have the same effect as Wortmannin on FOXO1A subcellular localization (and hence may be possible treatments for osteosarcoma patients), but possess fewer side effects than the known drugs."

You have a total of 26 images, with approximately 200 cells per image, so you want to automate the process of identifying and segmenting the cells. The first task is to set up a CellProfiler **pipeline** consisting of a number of individual **modules**; each module performs a unique image-processing step, and multiple modules can be arranged such that they are executed in sequential order. You will test your pipeline on a few images so that you can optimize the settings. Once optimization is complete, you will run the pipeline on all the images in the experiment, collect measurements from each cell and store them in a database. At this point, you will use CellProfiler Analyst to visualize your data, and use its machine learning tool to train the computer to distinguish between treated and untreated cells."
