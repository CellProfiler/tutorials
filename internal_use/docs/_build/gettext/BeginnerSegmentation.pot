msgid "is a high-content, high-throughput imaging technique used to capture a wide array of cellular phenotypes in response to diverse perturbations. Briefly, cells are treated with a variety of drugs, environmental changes or genetic perturbations (using CRISPR, for example) and then fixed and stained with six fluorescent dyes that mark different cellular compartments, including nuclei, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and actin."
