You can think of containers as \"a pre-configured operating system in a box\". Because they come to you pre-configured, installation of any software happens once-and-only-once (by the creator of the container, not by you), and should stay working for long after ie the latest Mac upgrade breaks a certain older software installation. Groups like [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) have already containerized many of the tools you know and love. There are a number of types of software containers, but one of the most common is called a **Docker** container."

If your classifier is good, that will give you an image where the pixels you care about are high-probability (bright) and everywhere else is low-probability (dark). That's exactly what we want!
