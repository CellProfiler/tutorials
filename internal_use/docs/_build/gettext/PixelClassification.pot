msgid "CellProfiler is capable of accurate and reliable segmentation of cells by utilizing a broad collection of classical image processing methods. Peruse the documentation on the [IdentifyPrimaryObjects] module, for example, to get a sense of these, e.g., thresholding, declumping, and watershed. However, despite the many problems CellProfiler can readily solve, certain types of images are particularly challenging. For instance, when the biologically relevant objects are defined more by texture and context than raw intensity many [classical image processing tecnhiques] can be foiled; DIC images of cells are a common biological example."

#: ../../source/PixelClassification/PixelClassification.md:36
msgid "Thankfully, machine learning, particularly [pixel-based classification] has yielded powerful techniques that can often solve these challenging cases. [ilastik] is an open-source tool built for pixel-based classification, and, when combined with CellProfiler, the range of biology that can be quantified from images is greatly expanded beyond monocultures of monolayers to include increased complexity such as tissues, organoids, or [co-cultures]."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/PixelClassification/PixelClassification.md:58
msgid "A straightforward thresholding of this image yields poor results, because the cells have almost the same pixel intensity values (and sometimes even darker!) as the background. There is therefore no true foreground for these cells based solely upon an intensity histogram. Thresholding renders the CHO cells into moon-like crescents. While these fragments could be useful for simple cell counting, most metrics of morphology will be inaccurate. Now, note that there is a module, EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures, that is specifically capable of transforming DIC images into something that is readily segmented. But let's pretend for a moment we didn't have that option..."

msgid "ilastik employs pixel-based classification and complements CellProfiler. The CHO cells within the DIC image are obvious to the human eye, because we can discern that each cell is defined by a characteristic combination of light and dark patterns. These same patterns can be detected with the machine-learning algorithms within ilastik."

msgid "The machine-learning implemented by ilastik requires user annotation about what is background and what is a CHO cell before it can automatically make this determination across a set of images. ilastik provides a user interface for labeling, tagging, and identifying the objects of interest within an image. This annotation creates what is referred to in machine learning as a training set."

msgid "We recommend creating labels for each class one pixel at a time, rather than by making scribbles, to minimize the chance of [over-fitting], i.e. too much information about any given area can cause classification to do poorly in other slightly-dissimilar areas. To label one pixel at a time, we’ll need to zoom in far enough to resolve the individual pixels in the image. The image below shows how closely we must view individual cells before the pixels of the image become clear."

In the next image, the annotation color of the CHO cell is yellow and the annotation color of the background is green. Activating *Live Update* reveals the segmentation looks similar to the results from thresholding. This outcome is promising considering this classification was determined by 1 feature and 1 pixel each for the *CHO* and *background* labels."

msgid "Adding more labels, one pixel at a time, we continue to refine the segmentation. Toggling the *Segmentation* and *Uncertainty* views provides real-time feedback that can guide the labeling process. Areas of high uncertainty will be aqua-blue, so annotating those areas will be most beneficial to training the program which pixels belong to which class. You should also view the predicted segmentation, and annotate pixels that are not currently segmented properly."
