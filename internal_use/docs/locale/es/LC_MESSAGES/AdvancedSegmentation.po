"The images in this experiment come from the `Broad Bioimage Benchmark "

"240 of 69,120 fields of U2OS cells treated with a panel of 1600 known "
"bioactive compounds and imaged in five channels for a so-called Cell "
"Painting assay- see Gustafsdottir et al, 2013 for more information. The "
"compounds target a wide range of cell pathways, meaning that some cells "
"and organelles will have very different morphologies both from each other"
" and from the mock treated controls. This will give you an opportunity to"

"Because you have different object counts for some of your different types"
" of objects (the counts of Nuclei, Cells, and Cytoplasm will be the same,"
" but the counts of Mitochondria and Nucleoli will not be), you will not "
"be able to export the objects as a single data table but must instead use"
" a different data table for each object. This will not affect the actual "
"outcome of the experiment, but will mean that each object will get its "
"own properties file and that you can only look at the measurement for one"
" object at a time in CellProfiler Analyst."
