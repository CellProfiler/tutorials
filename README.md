## BeginnerSegmentation

A tutorial that uses a CellPainting assay to ﬁnd segmentation
parameters for larger “parent” objects (nucleus, cell, and cytoplasm)
and show you ways to pull out smaller features in your image by
segmenting organelles within the nuclei. You will also be
shown how to use RelateObjects so that you can relate the average
counts, distances, and measurements of the smaller “child”
organelles to their larger “parent” objects.

The images used come from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection
(https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC022).
They are ﬁelds of U2OS cells (10 sites imaged in 5 channels), and
represent 5 mock treated wells from a single 384 well plate experiment.
